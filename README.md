# Inventory Management system

## Submission Notes
Ideally this would be done with a database, but I decided to go with a lightweighted version storing everything in memory to reduce development time. I'd be happy to discuss database schema, database atomicity and concurrency operations, and fail safe measures during an interview or followup, but the general idea would be having a rate_history table and an exchange_order table.

Outside of the two requested endpoints, I've added 3 other endpoints to help debugging, with the path `internal` in the URL.

Rebalancing is done on a simple percetage based redistribution. This allocates all inflows proportionally to outflows based on percentages of outflows, and each inflow is distributed across all outflows until inflow is fully depleted. All calculation is based on USD. For example, say we have USD +600, JPY +500, GBP -200, AUD -300 before the rebalancing, then 40% of the inflow (the excess USD) will go to GBP, and 60% will go to AUD, regardless of whether there is a net inflow or outflow. This ensures that high demand currencies are replenished proportional to their demand, and the distribution is based on a greedy approach for simplicity.

## Overview

Your task is to build a backend service that simulates an inventory management system for a company providing cross-border liquidity services. The company operates liquidity pools in multiple currencies and manages currency transfers for users sending funds between different currencies.

The system will support the following currencies:

- **USD**, **EUR**, **JPY**, **GBP**, and **AUD**.

## Objective

The key objectives are to create a system that:

- Manages liquidity pools across various currencies.
- Tracks inventory, revenue, and FX rates for each transaction.
- Dynamically rebalances liquidity pools based on transaction data to maintain optimal balances.

## Language and Framework:

- Preferred: Node.js with TypeScript.
- Alternative: Any language or framework of your choice is accepted.

## Requirements

1. API Endpoints

   - Transfer Request: `POST /transfer`

     - Accepts a transfer request from a sender to a receiver, converting currency X to currency Y.
     - Uses the FX rate to calculate the amount in currency Y and apply a transaction margin.
     - Immediately debits the amount in Y from the liquidity pool and records it.
     - Adds revenue based on the applied margin.
     - Takes into account currency-specific settlement times.
       - Note: In the real world, settlement times typically depend on the country and payment rails. For this exercise, however, weâ€™ll simplify by making settlement times dependent on the currency instead.

   - FX Rate Update: `POST /fx-rate`
     - Receives mock FX rates between supported currencies.
     - Updates the stored FX rates for use in transfer calculations.
     - The mock script, `mockFxRateSender.js`, should be used to send rate updates to this endpoint every 3-5 seconds.
       - Example payload from the script:
         ```
         {"pair":"AUD/JPY","rate":"82.6666","timestamp":"2024-11-11T11:22:18.123Z"}
         ```
     - The script will occasionally send extreme fluctuations (5% chance of a 5-10% change) to simulate market volatility.

2. Liquidity pool rebalancing

   - Periodically rebalance liquidity between pools to maintain optimal balances.
   - Takes into account transaction volume and send/receive imbalances.
   - Ensures each pool is adequately funded to meet anticipated demand.
   - Track available liquidity in each currency pool in real-time.

3. Revenue Calculation

   - Track revenue by calculating the margin on each transaction.

4. Foreign Exchange Rates

   - Store FX rates and allow historical lookups for use in transfer and revenue calculations.

5. Data Persistence

   - Use reliable data storage to maintain inventory levels, transactions, FX rates, and revenue.
   - Ensure atomicity and resilience to outages for each transaction.

6. Additional Requirements:

   - Use configuration files or environment variables for adjustable parameters, such as margin percentages, currency settlement times, and rebalance frequencies.
   - Ensure logging and error handling, especially for scenarios with missing liquidity or FX rates.

## Initial Balances per Currency

- **USD**: 1,000,000
- **EUR**: 921,658
- **JPY**: 109,890,110
- **GBP**: 750,000
- **AUD**: 1,349,528

## Currency Settlement Times

Each currency has a predefined settlement time, simulating the delay for funds to be confirmed in liquidity pools. These settlement times are specified in seconds for easy testing:

- **USD**: 3 seconds
- **EUR**: 2 seconds
- **JPY**: 3 seconds
- **GBP**: 2 seconds
- **AUD**: 3 seconds
